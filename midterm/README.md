-Assignment: midterm project 

As a visual artsits, I wanted to use processing as a canvas to create a interactive underground world

I found this amazing inspiration online for a interesting animation created by Ruiwen

The animation created by Ruiwen is really interesting so i modified her code to create the bubble animations.
