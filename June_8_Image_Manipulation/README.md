-Assignment: Do something creative with one or more image(s)

During the class, I was assigned into the same breakout room with Krzysztof. We discussed what we want to experiment to practice the skill we just learned. We decided that we want to make a guessing game.
However, the time during class is too short, So we decided to make this game for our homework as a group project. 

We thought it will be a good idea to display an image and then guess the image. The game will provide feedback and then go on to the next image.
This reminded me of some vocabulary learning applications I used before. So we decided that we will make it into a English vocab learning app.

I designed the first instruction page so the user will understand how to use the game. 
the program is easy to use and clear, the feedback from the program is shown by apearing different colored filter when you answer the question right or wrong.

Challenge:First we made our images random, however, we wanted to make our instruction image always appear as the first image.
