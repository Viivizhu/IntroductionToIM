Remember those times that you want to go to the bathroom at night but you cannot find the switch? I want to create a simple tool that helps with that inconvenience. This tool will have two LEDs, one LED is to indicate the switch for the other LED. So I want to have one LED that turns on when the surrounding is dark and turns off when the surrounding is bright. And the other LED is controlled by the switch. So in reality the other LED is our big lightbulb.

Challenge: the idea is pretty simple, I wanted to use it as a exercise to practice. When i am building it up, the light bulb with the switch was not able to turn on. I tried to test everything and see which part is not corrected correctly. However, later on I realize there's actually nothing wrong with my circuit. Is just that my room is really bright and the light is actualy on but it's super not obvious. Maybe my resistor is too high that the current is too low.
