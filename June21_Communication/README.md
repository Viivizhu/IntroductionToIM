- Assignment : Make a simple game that involves some kind of communication between Arduino and Processing. 

I was playing with the examples on adrino and play with different posibilities of communicating between arduino and processing. I used the example 'dimmer' and had fun with it.
Dimmer basically allows you to control the brightness of the LED according to where you mouse is. 

For this assignment, I decided to do something very simple so I can try to focus more on my final project. 
I modified my code from my previous octopus program. I wanted to make a warning by having the brightness of the LED HIGH when the mouse is closer to the octopus.

Here is a link to my final work: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1axh798Wl3ABd9SXGMOAF2fKoCdbIYgY2/view?usp=sharing)

My adrino broad is very simple. There is only one LED light connected to pin 13.
