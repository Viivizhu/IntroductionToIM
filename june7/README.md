Assignment :
- Create either a data visualization or a generative text.
- Create a simple work of art using one or more of the transformations. You can modify the art project you used before.

For the assignment, I choose to do a generative text.
Sylvia Plath is a poet I really like. So I want to arragange her words creatively using generative text.
I choose the poem "remember this is now"
It is a short poem with a lot of repetition. I want to try to create a movie poem that the reader can feel the emotions more.

For our reading habbits, We read from left to write (although in some culture that varies), So i arranged the lines of the poem from left to right as well

I want to use different colors to create a rythem of the poem. I used complementary color to create contrast and draw attentions in places that I think is important.

For some of the lines, I practiced using transformation that we learned from the previous class to create a vertial text.

Challenge:
I think there is definatly a easier way to write the code with arrays. I listed the lines of the poem out, I wonder if there is a way that assign different lines with different number, 
So, I don't need to list it all out if it is a longer poem.
