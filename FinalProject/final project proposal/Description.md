- Question 1: what your Arduino program will do with each input and output and what it will send to and/or receive from Processing

For my project, I will have an input from the ultrasonic sensor to detects sound wave and determine if the motor will move accoridng to the distance

- Question 2: what Processing program will do and what it will send to and/or receive from Arduino
Processing will be used to control the speed of the motor. Processing will receive the data from the mouse and send it to arduino to change the speed of the motor.
